### Password Manager
The aim to the present project is to solve the shared password problem in small teams.

### How it works
The first time that the script is runs asks for key/value input and generates the secrets file by using the public keys saved in pub-keys folder.
The menu accepts:
* Add Key/Value Pair
* Decrypt Key/Value Pair
* Show Keys
